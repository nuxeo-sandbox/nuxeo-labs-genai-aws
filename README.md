This plugin allows for calling Generative AI on AWS, using Bedrock.

First Use Case is about summarizing a text.

For now, we use Titan, as first test.

If you find this plugin and want to test it:

* Setup the correct environment so as to be able to call AWS
* Enable/Activate the following models on AWS: `amazon.titan-text-express-v1` and `anthropic.claude-v2`
* Run the unit tests. Notice we use only Titan, so far.

ToDo:

* Priority:
  * Handle text-based blobs (pdf, Word, mainly)
  * Add automation for easy call from Nuxeo in the UI
  * Add better result, with error when it occur (model not found, model does not support other languages, ...)
* Less urgent:
  * Make a configurable service (list models to use, bu then describe the input/output JSON format expected...)
  * Make more parameters available to tune the call to the service
  * Make the cal async
  * Maybe make a service where other providers can be plugged?
  * ...
