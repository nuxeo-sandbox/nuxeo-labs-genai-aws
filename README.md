This plugin allows for calling Generative AI on AWS, using Bedrock.

First Use Case is about summarizing a text.

For now, we use Titan, as first test.

If you find this plugin and want to test it:

* Setup the correct environment so as to be able to call AWS
* Enable/Activate the following models on AWS: `amazon.titan-text-express-v1` and `anthropic.claude-v2`
* Run the unit tests. Notice we use only Titan, so far.
